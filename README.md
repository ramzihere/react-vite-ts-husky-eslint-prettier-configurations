# Starter Project

## React + Vite + TypeScript + Husky + ESLint + Prettier

This is a starter template for building React applications with TypeScript, Vite for fast development, Husky for pre-commit validations, ESLint for code quality and error detection and Prettier for consistent code formatting.

## Features

-   React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
-   Vite: A fast build tool that provides instant server start and hot module replacement (HMR).

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js & npm installed on your development machine.

## Installation

1 Clone this repository:

-   git clone <https://github.com/ramzihere/react-vite-ts-husky-eslint-prettier-configurations.git>

2 Navigate into the project directory:

-   cd react-vite-ts-husky-eslint-prettier-configurations

3 Install dependencies:

```js
# using npm
npm install

# OR using yarn
yarn install
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```js
# using npm
npm run dev

# OR using yarn
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server at <http://localhost:3000>.

## Build

To build the project for production, run:

```js
# using npm
npm run build

# OR using yarn
